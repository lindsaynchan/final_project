#Final Project for Hackbright Intro Class
#For my final project, I'll be creating a Mad Libs program. This program will ask the user for input of verbs, nouns and adjectives to fill in the blanks of a story. If there's time, I will create an option for the user to create their own story. This would probably involve a two player element.
#Will utilize lists, dictionaries and modules
